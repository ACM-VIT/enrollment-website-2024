## <center>Welcome to ACM Registrations! </center>

As you can see with our magnificent website, we are a technical chapter. <br>
And a damn good one. Just kidding, we are humble. <br>
(_not kidding about the good part - Sorry, I crack lame jokes when I get nervous..._) <br>

Anyways, let's help you figure out **our registration process - step by step...**

<!--Section ends here -->
## 🧑 Personal Info & Configuration
In the bottom left corner of your screen, you will see three icons: <br>

1. **PROFILE** - Check your details and make sure they are \`filled correctly\`.
2. **COLOUR** - Use this to switch from light to dark mode and vice-versa.
3. **TERMINAL** - Here's where all your commands will run.

>**Also,** don't forget to follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/acmvit/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/acmvit) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACM_VIT)!

<!--Section ends here -->
## 🔓 GETTING STARTED

Your ACM journey begins with the **ACM Mainframe Terminal.** <br> <br>

1. Click on the last icon \`Terminal\` on the bottom-left corner of the website. <br><br>
![Alt text](terminal.jpg)

2. As requested, you can see all the commands at your disposal using \`help\` <br><br>
![Alt text](help.png)

There are 5 commands, and you've now already tested \`help\`. Here's what the rest are for:<br>
|Commands| Purpose|
|-----|-----|
|\`clear\`| If you played with the terminal too much and find it clattered, it clears it up.
|\`register\` \`domain\`| You'll use this to access your domain forms |
|\`formsubmit\` \`domain\`| You'll use this to submit your domain forms|
|\`exit\`| If your work is done or terminal is hindering view|

Now, to the main course... 

<!-- Section ends here -->
## 👑 DOMAINS & REGISTRATIONS

ACM-VIT have several domains that may interest you. <br>
Before filling out your forms, <b>we highly encourage</b> you to go through each of our domains and what we do. <br>
<br>
On the top-left corner of our website, do the following: <br>
underneath \`EXPLORER\` -> \`domains\` -> read through all \`.md\` files.

> **NOTE** <br>
Irrespective of how many domains you apply to, if selected, you win be assigned to only one particular domain.

> **IMPORTANT** <br>
    For the commands you're about to type next, you'll need a _execution time of 2 sec._

Now that you've read about all the domains, it's time to fill your application form(s).
1. Open \`Terminal\` and run \`register\` \`domain_name\` to access the form for that domain_name. 
<br> Let's say you want to apply for web, your command would be \`register web\`.<br><br>
![Alt text](register.png) 

2. Once you get message **"Registration Successful"**, you will find a new \`forms\` folder underneath \`EXPLORER\`.
<br>
Based on the domains you've registered, you'll find different \`.py\` files with domain-specific questions.<br><br>
![Alt text](forms.png)

3. You can begin answering the questions.<br>
For **Short & Long Answers**, answer within \`" "\`.<br>
For **MCQs**, just click on \`true\` or \`false\` for each option. 
<br>

>  !! **CAUTION** !!<br>
Autosave only works every 5 seconds. Please be patient with your responses.

## ✔️ Submission

Once you're done with filling your forms, you can proceed to submit the form.

> !! **WARNING** !! <br>
Once you submit your form, you _lose viewing and editing access_ to it.

For each form, you'll have to submit using \`formsubmit\` \`domain_name\` and _wait 2 seconds_ for submission. <br><br>
![Alt text](formsubmit.png)

Once you see this, that means your form has been submitted successfully.<br>
> NOTE <br>
Your \`domain_name.py\` file will automatically disappear from the \`forms\` folder post submission.

## 🔜 What's Next?

It's alright, boss! You can relax after submitting your forms. <br>
If you make it through, we will get back to you with updates shortly.

> **DISCLAIMER** <br>
Due to the high quantity of incoming forms, it won't be possible for us to give individual feedback for every individual and form.

### BEST OF LUCK!

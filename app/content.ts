# Instructions & Navigation
<!-- Chalo shuru karte hai aaj ki bakchodi -->

## Welcome to ACM Registrations! 

As you can see with our magnificent website, we are a technical chapter.
And a damn good one. Just kidding, we are humble.
(not kidding about the good part - Sorry, I crack weird jokes when I get nervous...) <br>

Anyways, let's help you figure out **our registration process - step by step..**

**IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE THE WEBSITE ON A BIGGER SCREEN TO ACCESS ALL FEATURES!!!**

<!--Section ends here -->
## 📖 Personal Info & Configuration
In the bottom left corner of your screen, you will see three icons: <br>

1. **PROFILE** - Check your details and make sure they are \`filled correctly\`.
2. **THEME** - Use this to switch from light to dark mode and vice-versa.
3. **TERMINAL** - Here's where all your commands will run.

>**Also,** don't forget to follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/acmvit/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/acmvit) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACM_VIT)!

<!--Section ends here -->
## GETTING STARTED

Your ACM journey begins with the **ACM Mainframe Terminal.** <br>

1. Click on the last icon \`Terminal\` on the bottom-left corner of the website. <br>
![Alt text](/terminal.jpg)

2. As requested, you can see all the commands at your disposal using \`help\` <br>
![Alt text](/help.png)

There are 5 commands, and you've now already tested \`help\`. Here's what the rest are for:<br>

\|Commands| Purpose|
|-----|-----|
|\`clear\`| If you played with the terminal too much and find it clattered, it clears it up.
|\`register domain\`| You'll use this to access your domain forms |
|\`formsubmit domain\`| You'll use this to submit your domain forms|
|\`exit\`| If your work is done or terminal is hindering view|\
Now, to the main course... 

<!-- Section ends here -->
## DOMAINS & REGISTRATIONS

ACM-VIT have several domains that may interest you. 
Before filling out your forms, <b>we highly encourage</b> you to go through each of our domains and what we do. <br>

On the top-left corner of our website, do the following:
underneath \`EXPLORER\` -> \`domains\` -> read through all \`.md\` files.

> **NOTE**
Irrespective of how many domains you apply to, if selected, you will be assigned to only one particular domain.

> **IMPORTANT**
For the commands you're about to type next, you'll need an _execution time of 2 secs._
<br>
Now that you've read about all the domains, it's time to fill your application form(s).
1. Open \`Terminal\` and run \`register domain_name\` to access the form for that domain_name. 
Let's say you want to apply for web, your command would be \`register web\`.<br><br>
![Alt text](/register.png)
    
2. Once you get message **"Registration Successful"**, you will find a new \`forms\` folder underneath \`EXPLORER\`.

Based on the domains you've registered, you'll find different \`.py\` files with domain-specific questions.<br>
![Alt text](/forms.png)
    
3. You can begin answering the questions.
For **Short & Long Answers**, answer within \`" "\`.
For **MCQs & SCQs**, just click on \`true\` or \`false\` for each option.    
> !! **CAUTION** !!
Autosave takes a time of **5 secs** after you stop typing. Please be patient with your responses.

## Submission

Once you're done with filling your forms, you can proceed to submit the form.

> !! **WARNING** !!
Once you submit your form, you _lose viewing and editing access_ to it.

For each form, you'll have to submit using \`formsubmit domain_name\` and _wait 2 seconds_ for submission. <br>
![Alt text](/formsubmit.png)
Once you see this, that means your form has been submitted successfully.<br>
> **NOTE** 
Your \`domain_name.py\` file will automatically disappear from the \`forms\` folder post submission.

## What's Next?

It's alright, boss! You can relax after submitting your forms.
If you make it through, we will get back to you with updates shortly.

> **DISCLAIMER**
Due to the high quantity of incoming forms, it won't be possible for us to give individual feedback for every individual and form.

### ALL THE BEST !
